The meme suggests that the media often portrays Muslims as being responsible for any negative events that occur in India, regardless of the actual circumstances. This representation perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reinforces Islamophobic attitudes, contributing to a broader narrative of discrimination and marginalization against Muslims in Indian society.\n",
