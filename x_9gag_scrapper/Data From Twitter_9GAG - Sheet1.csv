And this is more proof that anyone who is voting for trump is voting for the kind of rhetoric that would turn an entire bigoted slice of his base against a group of people based on the religion they practice. I'll admit that President Biden isn't perfect, but he's head and shoulders better than the twice-impeached hate monger who is only running for President to avoid prison.
I'll take four more years of President Biden over another nano second of the shit stain that is Donald trump.",

See if you search her name, you will find her listed as ""Human Rights Activist"". I am not joking. But she is only interested in pushing the Islamic agenda. To call herself Human Rights Activist, one would expect she values all human rights? Right? Ask her what is her views of apostates of Islam and their rights?

Do you see me using pig faces or degrading nudity photos of the prophet or his wives? Do you see me using photos turning Kabaa into a toilet or more importantly do you ever seem me generalising and attacking people who believe in Islam with insults...as some do? The answer is no. I present my views and observations of Islam using memes. Memes need to have a touch of satire or parody to lighten the subject and allow people to see the irony of the situation.

Just because you dislike them, you cannot call me Islamophobe...when I talk about women war bounty, this is from the Quran.and Hadith, when I talk about Muhammad's many many marriages, this is in the Quran and hadith, when I talk about the scientific errors and contradictions in the Quran, I am providing the evidence with a light hearted image to show how ridiculous the logic is, like in this meme. None of this is Islamophobic! Learn the difference between attacking people, and mocking contradictions in a faith. The
